# :ok_woman: {who}

As you've probably already noticed, my name is Catherine

# :computer: {what}

During the day, I work as a bioinformatics analyst (i.e, a person that transforms
various sets of numbers into pretty pictures). At night, you can find me kicking
around a soccer ball, attempting to cook a dish I found online, and/or hanging out
with my dog (click on the Instagram link if you want a little surprise...).

# :office: {where}

In 2015, I graduated from McMaster University with an honours bachelor's degree
in Health Sciences with a specialization in Global Health. Then, in 2018, I completed
my Master's degree in Molecular Genetics from the University of Toronto. Currently,
I (virtually) work at the Donnelly Centre for Biomolecular Research for the labs of
[Charlie Boone](http://sites.utoronto.ca/boonelab/people/index.shtml) and
[Jason Moffat](http://moffatlab.ccbr.utoronto.ca/?page_id=60).

# :clock1: {when}

I officially started working in bioinformatics a short while after I graduated
in 2018.

# :question: {why}

Playing around with data is fun!
