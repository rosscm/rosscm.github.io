Thanks for stopping by! I am a bioinformatics analyst based in Toronto who uses
R to create captivating graphics and software packages.

Click through the site and get to know more about me. I like to talk about
things ranging from R software development to my favourite ways to keep organized.
All without the fancy jargon you may expect from a *science-y* person :v:
