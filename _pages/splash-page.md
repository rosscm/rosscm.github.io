Thanks for stopping by! I am a bioinformatics analyst based in Toronto who uses
R, along with other programming tools, to create captivating graphics and
software packages.

Click through the site and get to know more about me. I like to talk about
things ranging from R package development to my favourite ways to keep organized.
All without the fancy jargon you may expect from a *science-y* person :v:
