Here are some of the software I currently use for my everyday coding needs.

## Code editor

* [Atom](https://atom.io/) -- text editor
* [Nv Dark](https://atom.io/packages/nv-dark-ui) -- UI theme
* [Nv Dark](https://atom.io/packages/nv-dark-syntax) -- Syntax theme
* [r-exec](https://atom.io/packages/r-exec) -- send R code to various R consoles
* [language-r](https://atom.io/packages/language-r) -- language description and snippets for R
> This package is currently unmaintained, but I personally prefer the syntax highlighting
of this package compared to [atom-language-r](https://atom.io/packages/atom-language-r)

## Terminal

* Terminal -- built-in MacOS
* [Duotone Dark](https://github.com/lysyi3m/macos-terminal-themes) -- macOS terminal theme

switch between several installed R versions
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) -- open-source vector graphic software
